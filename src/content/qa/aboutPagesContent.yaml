    - paragraph: "INS OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE"
    - paragraph: "NCI leadership, cancer researchers, and the public are currently unable to holistically find and access information about the large amount of data generated by NCI-supported studies. The Index of NCI Studies (INS) goal is to enable transparency and data sharing accountability so that NCI leadership, researchers, and the public can rapidly assess the state of science at a single location. This will facilitate their ability to plan new directions for research, support data sharing compliance as stipulated in the original award, and monitor that data is placed in NIH-approved repositories in a timely fashion. The focus of INS is any NCI-supported study that generates research outputs, such as publications, datasets, or patents. These studies may be awarded through intramural or extramural grants, contracts, awards under Other Transactional Authority (OTA), or Interagency Agreements (IAAs).  INS obtains award information from key source systems such as grant management, budget, and classification systems to create the universe of known NCI-supported studies. INS requests information from resources that hold publications, data, and other research outputs to calculate data sharing metrics. Examples of these resources are PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, GEO, SRA, dbGaP, and the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)."
    - paragraph: "DATA GATHERING PROCESS"
    - paragraph: "INS starts its data gathering process with an NCI-funded program of interest such as the Cancer Moonshot program or the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI). Each program consists of a list of awards. General award information—such as project title, principal investigators, award amount, and award start and end dates—is obtained from NIH RePORTER. Research outputs are obtained by website data gathering processes. PubMed is first queried with the list of project IDs. Authors typically list their funding sources in PubMed’s Grant Support section. The list of publications associated with those project IDs is collected. If there are any datasets or clinical trials associated with a particular publication, authors will typically list those related research outputs in PubMed’s Related Information Section, which the data gathering process then collects. The INS data gathering process also queries ClinicalTrials.gov and the USPTO independently with the list of project IDs. All research outputs are thus linked to the project ID(s) that produced them."

    - paragraph: "SITE FUNCTIONALITY"
    - paragraph: "Home Page"
    - paragraph: "Provides a snapshot of the number of programs, projects, and research outputs in the site."
    - paragraph: "Programs Page"
    - paragraph: "Provides a list of programs currently included in the site, together with the program websites and number of projects and publications in each program."
    - paragraph: "Project Page"
    - paragraph: "Provides a comprehensive list of projects and research outputs in the site. The list of projects and research outputs can be filtered by program, DOC (division, office, or center), fiscal year, and award amount. Doughnut charts provide basic project metrics that are updated as filters are applied. The user can choose to view the project list or any of the research outputs list (publications, datasets, etc.) by selecting the corresponding tab."
    - paragraph: "About Page"
