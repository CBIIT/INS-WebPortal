              </h2>
              <p>
                The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is pleased to release the next phase of the Index of NCI Studies (INS) to tackle the challenge of assembling NCI program information from publicly available resources. Building connections between NCI programs, projects, grants, and research outputs is a complex task typically addressed through manual curation by portfolio analysis experts. Due to the challenging nature of curating this information, the INS is not comprehensive - additional information will be added in an iterative fashion. For detailed documentation about the information within INS, please see our open-source
